I used Storybook to create the UI components and pages and leave them in isolation. A very powerful tool for organizing and documenting your Design System! At first glance, it adds complexity to the project, but it is very useful and at the end of the project, I was grateful for having used it.

## üìö Learning
I learned a lot developing this project, I learned concepts and tools that are extremely important for a front-end developer! One of these tools was Storybook, which is very useful for isolating application components. In addition, I learned CI/CD concepts and also how to automate application deployment, which can be seen in this application! It was a very rewarding project, with great learnings.
